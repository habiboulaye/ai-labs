# Deep Learning for Malaria Diagnosis

Malaria is an infectuous disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.

The Malaria burden with some key figures:
<font color='red'>
* More than 219 million cases
* Over 430 000 deaths in 2017 (Mostly: children & pregnants)
* 80% in 15 countries of Africa & India
  </font>

The malaria diagnosis is performed using blood test:
* Collect patient blood smear 
* Microscopic visualisation of the parasit

Main issues related to traditional diagnosis: 
<font color='#ed7d31'>
* resource-constrained regions 
* time needed and delays
* diagnosis accuracy and cost

The objective of this notebook is to apply modern deep learning techniques to perform medical image analysis for malaria diagnosis.
